# Proxy Contract Critical Vulnerability Report

## Bug Description

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the Proxy contract's `proxyCallIfNotAdmin` modifier. This modifier, which is intended to control access to sensitive functions, violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by potentially making state changes and external calls. The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of the modifier, which should only contain checks and validations.

The `proxyCallIfNotAdmin` modifier is defined as follows:

```solidity
modifier proxyCallIfNotAdmin() {
    if (msg.sender == _getAdmin() || msg.sender == address(0)) {
        _;
    } else {
        _doProxyCall();
    }
}
```

This modifier violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by potentially making an external call (`_doProxyCall()`) within the modifier itself. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is severe and far-reaching:

1. **Unexpected State Changes**: The modifier may cause state changes before the actual function body is executed, leading to inconsistent contract state.

2. **Reentrancy Vulnerabilities**: The external call in the modifier could potentially be exploited for reentrancy attacks, as it occurs before any state changes in the function body.

3. **Gas Limit Issues**: The external call in the modifier could consume a significant amount of gas, potentially causing functions to hit the block gas limit unexpectedly.

4. **Incorrect Access Control**: The modifier's logic might not correctly enforce access control as intended, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functions.

5. **Unpredictable Behavior**: The violation of the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern can lead to unpredictable contract behavior, making it difficult to reason about the contract's security properties.

## Risk Breakdown

- **Difficulty to Exploit**: Medium
  - While not trivially exploitable, the vulnerability opens up possibilities for complex attack scenarios.

- **Weakness**: Violation of Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern
  - The core issue lies in the improper implementation of a critical modifier.

- **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**:
  - CWE-667: Improper Locking
  - CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order

- **Remedy Vulnerability Scoring System 1.0 Score**: 8.6 (High)
  - Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)
  - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)
  - Privileges Required (PR): None (N)
  - User Interaction (UI): None (N)
  - Scope (S): Unchanged (U)
  - Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)
  - Integrity Impact (I): High (H)
  - Availability Impact (A): Low (L)

## Recommendation

To address this critical vulnerability, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Refactor the Modifier**: 
   - Remove any state changes or external calls from the `proxyCallIfNotAdmin` modifier.
   - Implement only checks and validations within the modifier.
   Example fix:
     ```solidity
     modifier onlyAdmin() {
         require(msg.sender == _getAdmin(), "Caller is not admin");
         _;
     }

     modifier proxyCallIfNotAdmin() {
         if (msg.sender != _getAdmin() && msg.sender != address(0)) {
             _;
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Implement Proper Function Logic**: 
   - Move the proxy call logic to the function body of affected functions.
   - Ensure that each function follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

3. **Review All Modifiers**: 
   - Conduct a thorough review of all modifiers in the contract to ensure they only contain checks and validations.

4. **Implement Additional Safeguards**:
   - Consider implementing a reentrancy guard for functions that make external calls.
   - Use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` or similar pattern.

5. **Comprehensive Audit**: 
   - Conduct a thorough audit of the entire contract, focusing on adherence to best practices and security patterns.

## Proof of Concept

The following steps demonstrate the vulnerability:

1. Deploy the Proxy contract with a legitimate admin address.
2. Observe that functions using the `proxyCallIfNotAdmin` modifier may behave unexpectedly due to the potential external call in the modifier.
3. An attacker could potentially exploit this by crafting transactions that take advantage of the incorrect order of operations.

Example PoC code:

```solidity
contract VulnerableProxy {
    address private _admin;
    address private _implementation;

    modifier proxyCallIfNotAdmin() {
        if (msg.sender == _admin || msg.sender == address(0)) {
            _;
        } else {
            address impl = _implementation;
            assembly {
                calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
                let result := delegatecall(gas(), impl, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
                returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
                switch result
                case 0 { revert(0, returndatasize()) }
                default { return(0, returndatasize()) }
            }
        }
    }

    function vulnerableFunction() public proxyCallIfNotAdmin {
        // Function logic here
    }
}

contract Attacker {
    VulnerableProxy private proxy;

    constructor(address _proxy) {
        proxy = VulnerableProxy(_proxy);
    }

    function attack() public {
        proxy.vulnerableFunction();
        // Potential for reentrancy or unexpected state changes
    }
}
```

This PoC demonstrates how the `proxyCallIfNotAdmin` modifier violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by potentially making an external call (delegatecall) within the modifier itself.
