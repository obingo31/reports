Summary

The AssetSwapPathStorage contract does not fully comply with ERC-7201 due to an incorrect storage namespace calculation. This issue could lead to unintended storage collisions and data corruption across multiple contracts.

Vulnerability Details
The contract defines its storage layout using incomplete ERC-7201 Implementation:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

library AssetSwapPath {
    /// @notice ERC7201 storage location.
    bytes32 internal constant ASSET_SWAP_STRATEGY_LOCATION =
        keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("fi.zaros.market-making.AssetSwapPath")) - 1));
```
It's missing the & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff)) mask that is crucial for the ERC-7201 namespace pattern to prevent storage collisions. The correct implementation should include the & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff)) mask.

The storage slot calculation is vulnerable to collisions due to the improper ERC-7201 implementation. 

```solidity
function load(address asset) internal pure returns (Data storage assetSwapPath) {
    bytes32 slot = keccak256(abi.encode(ASSET_SWAP_STRATEGY_LOCATION, asset));
    assembly {
        assetSwapPath.slot := slot
    }
}
```
Without this mask, multiple contracts that use similar namespace derivations may overwrite each other’s storage, leading to unintended data corruption.

Impact
 Due to improper ERC-7201 implementation, different assets could map to the same storage slot

If the namespace mask is not applied, multiple contracts may unintentionally overwrite each other’s storage.

Data from one contract may be mistakenly read or modified by another contract using a conflicting storage slot.

Tools Used
Manual

Recommendations
```solidity
bytes32 internal constant ASSET_SWAP_STRATEGY_LOCATION =
    keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("fi.zaros.market-making.AssetSwapPath")) - 1)) & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff));
```

Correcting the Storage Namespace Calculation

Ensures compliance with ERC-7201 by applying the required namespace mask.

Prevents potential storage collisions across different contracts using ERC-7201.

Implementing this fix, will fully align with ERC-7201, reducing the risk of storage conflicts and improving reliability.
