# Front-Running Vulnerability in Tax Rate Updates

## Impact

High. The `updateTaxRate` function in the `LandManager` contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks. Malicious actors could observe pending transactions that update tax rates and quickly submit their own transactions with higher gas prices to manipulate the system in their favor. This could lead to unfair advantages, financial losses for honest users, and overall disruption of the intended game mechanics.

## Proof of Concept (POC)

The vulnerability exists in the `updateTaxRate` function:

```solidity
function updateTaxRate(uint256 newTaxRate) external override notPaused {
    (address landlord, ) = _getMainAccountRequireRegistered(msg.sender);
    if (newTaxRate < MIN_TAX_RATE || newTaxRate > MAX_TAX_RATE)
        revert InvalidTaxRateError();
    if (plotMetadata[landlord].lastUpdated == 0)
        revert PlotMetadataNotUpdatedError();
    uint256 oldTaxRate = plotMetadata[landlord].currentTaxRate;
    plotMetadata[landlord].currentTaxRate = newTaxRate;
    emit TaxRateChanged(landlord, oldTaxRate, newTaxRate);
}
```

To exploit this:
1. An attacker monitors the mempool for `updateTaxRate` transactions.
2. When a legitimate user submits a transaction to lower their tax rate, the attacker quickly submits two transactions:
   a. One to lower their own tax rate to the minimum allowed.
   b. Another to raise it back up, with a slightly higher gas price than the victim's transaction.
3. The attacker's transactions are processed before the victim's, allowing the attacker to briefly benefit from a lower tax rate.

## Tools Used

- Mempool monitoring tools
- Custom scripts to automate transaction submission
- Ethereum node for quick transaction propagation

## Quantitative Analysis

Let's consider a scenario to quantify potential losses:

Assume:
- Current tax rate: 10%
- Minimum tax rate: 5%
- BASE_SCHNIBBLE_RATE: 1 schnibble per second
- Value of schnibbles: $0.01 per 1000 schnibbles
- Time window for exploitation: 1 hour

Scenario:
1. Legitimate user attempts to lower tax rate from 10% to 7%.
2. Attacker front-runs with a 5% tax rate for 1 hour.

Calculations:
- Normal earnings (10% tax): 3600 * 0.9 = 3240 schnibbles
- Intended earnings (7% tax): 3600 * 0.93 = 3348 schnibbles
- Attacker's earnings (5% tax): 3600 * 0.95 = 3420 schnibbles

The attacker gains an extra 180 schnibbles over the normal rate, or 72 schnibbles more than the intended rate.

In a day, this could amount to 4,320 extra schnibbles, or about $0.0432.
Over a year, this becomes 1,576,800 extra schnibbles, or about $15.77.

While these numbers might seem small, consider:
1. This is for a single hour of exploitation. Repeated attacks could multiply this significantly.
2. In a game economy, even small advantages can compound over time and across multiple players.
3. If the attacker operates on a larger scale (e.g., with multiple accounts or larger staked amounts), the gains could be much more substantial.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

1. Implement a commit-reveal scheme for tax rate updates:

```solidity
mapping(address => bytes32) public taxRateCommitments;
mapping(address => uint256) public commitmentTimestamps;

function commitTaxRate(bytes32 commitment) external {
    taxRateCommitments[msg.sender] = commitment;
    commitmentTimestamps[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
}

function revealTaxRate(uint256 newTaxRate, bytes32 salt) external notPaused {
    require(block.timestamp >= commitmentTimestamps[msg.sender] + 1 hours, "Commitment period not over");
    require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(newTaxRate, salt)) == taxRateCommitments[msg.sender], "Invalid reveal");
    
    // Existing tax rate update logic
    // ...

    delete taxRateCommitments[msg.sender];
    delete commitmentTimestamps[msg.sender];
}
```

2. Use a Dutch auction mechanism for tax rate changes:

```solidity
struct TaxRateAuction {
    uint256 startRate;
    uint256 endRate;
    uint256 startTime;
    uint256 duration;
}

mapping(address => TaxRateAuction) public taxRateAuctions;

function startTaxRateAuction(uint256 targetRate, uint256 duration) external {
    require(duration >= 1 hours && duration <= 24 hours, "Invalid duration");
    uint256 currentRate = plotMetadata[msg.sender].currentTaxRate;
    taxRateAuctions[msg.sender] = TaxRateAuction(currentRate, targetRate, block.timestamp, duration);
}

function finalizeTaxRateAuction() external notPaused {
    TaxRateAuction memory auction = taxRateAuctions[msg.sender];
    require(block.timestamp >= auction.startTime + auction.duration, "Auction not finished");
    
    // Calculate final rate
    uint256 newRate = auction.startRate + ((auction.endRate - auction.startRate) * (block.timestamp - auction.startTime)) / auction.duration;
    
    // Update tax rate logic
    // ...

    delete taxRateAuctions[msg.sender];
}
```

3. Implement rate limiting on tax changes:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public lastTaxUpdateTime;

function updateTaxRate(uint256 newTaxRate) external notPaused {
    require(block.timestamp >= lastTaxUpdateTime[msg.sender] + 1 days, "Rate limit exceeded");
    
    // Existing tax rate update logic
    // ...

    lastTaxUpdateTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
}
```

These mitigation strategies would significantly reduce the risk of front-running attacks on tax rate updates, ensuring fairer gameplay and protecting users from potential exploitation.
