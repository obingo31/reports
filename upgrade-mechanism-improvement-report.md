# Medium-Risk Finding: Upgrade Mechanism Improvements for Enhanced Security and Transparency

## Severity
Medium

## Likelihood
Medium

## Impact
Medium

## Description
While the current upgrade mechanism implemented through the `setCode` function is protected by the `proxyCallIfNotOwner` modifier, there are opportunities to enhance its security, transparency, and alignment with best practices in upgradeable contracts.

```solidity
function setCode(bytes memory _code) external proxyCallIfNotOwner {
    // ... [function body]
}
```

Although the owner is trusted, implementing additional safeguards can protect against potential mistakes, provide better transparency for users, and align with industry best practices.

## Impact
The current implementation, while secure under the assumption of a trusted owner, could be improved to:
1. Prevent accidental deployment of incorrect or incompatible code.
2. Provide users with transparency and time to react to upcoming changes.
3. Protect against potential key compromise scenarios without requiring immediate owner key rotation.
4. Enhance overall protocol governance and decentralization.

## Risk Breakdown
Difficulty to Exploit: Low (Not an exploit, but a potential for improvement)
Weakness: Upgradeable Contract Best Practices

## Recommendation
1. Implement a time-lock mechanism for upgrades:
   - This allows users to review pending upgrades and react if necessary.
   - It provides a safeguard against accidental deployment of incorrect code.

2. Add version control and compatibility checks:
   - Ensure new implementations are compatible with the current contract state.
   - Prevent deployment of older or incompatible versions.

3. Enhance event emissions:
   - Emit detailed events for proposed and executed upgrades.
   - Include version numbers, proposal timestamps, and execution timestamps.

4. Consider a two-step upgrade process:
   - Step 1: Propose an upgrade (emits event, starts time-lock).
   - Step 2: Finalize the upgrade after the time-lock period.

5. Implement optional multi-signature approval:
   - While keeping the current owner model, add an optional multi-sig feature for critical upgrades.

6. Add a contract verification step:
   - Verify the bytecode or source code of the new implementation against a known good version.

## Proof Of Concept
No explicit proof of concept is needed as this is a suggestion for improvement rather than an exploit. However, here's a conceptual example of an improved upgrade process:

```solidity
function proposeUpgrade(bytes memory _code) external onlyOwner {
    // Hash the new code and store the proposal
    bytes32 codeHash = keccak256(_code);
    upgradeProposal = UpgradeProposal(codeHash, block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_PERIOD);
    emit UpgradeProposed(codeHash, block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_PERIOD);
}

function executeUpgrade() external onlyOwner {
    require(block.timestamp >= upgradeProposal.executionTime, "Timelock period not elapsed");
    // ... [rest of the upgrade logic]
    emit UpgradeExecuted(upgradeProposal.codeHash, block.timestamp);
}
```

This example demonstrates a time-locked, two-step upgrade process with enhanced event emissions for better transparency.
